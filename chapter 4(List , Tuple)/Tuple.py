#Implement Tuple 

# Tuple -> Same as List but im mutable 

# How to declare Tuple -> a=();
# TUple with one element -> a=(1,) ,,,, (,) is necessary as without it the vs will see it as int not Tuple

a=();
b=(1);
c=(1,);

print(type(a));

print(type(b));

print(type(c));

# METHODS 

# a.count (1): a count (1) will return number of times 1 occurs in a.
# a.index (1) will return the index of first occurrence of 1 in a.
